<h1><span class="section-number">5. </span>Game Master Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#game-master-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Running Pathfinder Society games is similar to running a home campaign with a few house rules established by campaign leadership. In addition to GM Basics, be sure to familiarize yourself with the contents of the <a class="reference internal" href="welcome.html#welcome-to-pathfidner-society"><span class="std std-ref">Welcome to Pathfidner Society</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="standards.html#community-standards-expectations"><span class="std std-ref">Community Standards &amp; Expectations</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="playerBasics.html#player-basics"><span class="std std-ref">Player Basics</span></a>. You need to know what players know, what their expectations are, and how their characters are created, played, and advanced.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">5.1. </span>What Is A GM?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-gm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A Game Master (GM) is the person who presents the story, adjudicates the rules, and establishes the parameters of the player’s exploration. A GM’s duty is to provide a fair and fun game for all involved, including themselves. In the Pathfinder Society, a GM has a few other duties, listed in Your Duties as a Game Master below.</p>
<div class="section" id="who-can-be-a-game-master">
<h3>Who Can Be A Game Master?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-can-be-a-game-master" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Anyone with a <a class="reference internal" href="welcome.html#register-for-organized-play"><span class="std std-ref">valid Organized Play ID</span></a> can run Pathfinder Society adventures. As local Pathfinder Society groups and the campaign as a whole benefit as the pool of Game Masters increases, the venture-officer network provides support and guidance for any who want to GM.</p>

<div class="section" id="your-duties-as-game-master">
<h3>Your Duties As Game Master<a class="headerlink" href="#your-duties-as-game-master" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a Pathfinder Society GM, you have the following duties:
- Communicate with your local event coordinator.
- Prepare an adventure to offer to players, including gathering the necessary supplies such as maps, miniatures, and reference materials.
- Provide a welcoming environment for players.
- Deliver session results to the player via established recording mechanisms.
- Report the results of the game.</p>

<h3>Where Can I Buy Adventures?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-can-i-buy-adventures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Paizo produces two categories of adventures, available for purchase at <a class="reference external" href="https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety">paizo.com</a>.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Society adventures, including quests, scenarios, and bounties, generally release during the last week of each month. Current production rates include two new scenarios and one bounty monthly, with additional Society content released periodically throughout the year. These adventures are written expressly for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Adventures, including Adventure Paths, Modules, and Stand-alone adventures, are produced monthly. These adventures are oftentimes sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign. Information on how to incorporate them into your Society experience is found on each product’s description page at paizo.com. (See <a class="reference internal" href="playerBasics.html#adventures"><span class="std std-ref">Adventures</span></a> for more about these products.)</p>

<div class="section" id="reviewing-chronicles">
<h3>Reviewing Chronicles<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-chronicles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If time permits, GMs and Event Coordinators should spend a few minutes reviewing players’ Chronicles at the start of an event slot. These reviews can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, GMs might need to check to the Adventure Summary section to learn what a character did in a previous adventure, and GMs and Coordinators can review Chronicles to ensure that they are filled out correctly. These reviews can help ensure that players understand the rules of Pathfinder and the Pathfinder Society Campaign, as well as catch the errors that naturally crop up in the course of play.  (See <a class="reference internal" href="#dealing-with-chronicle-errors"><span class="std std-ref">Dealing with Chronicle Errors</span></a> for more on this.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="challenge-points">
<h3>Challenge Points<a class="headerlink" href="#challenge-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In a typical home game, the PCs would all be the same level and face challenges tailored to their level. In an organized play environment, though, there needs to be more flexibility to make it easier for players whose characters are of different levels to participate in the same adventure.</p>
<p>Each scenario or quest will list the levels of characters able to play in it, as well one or more level ranges within the adventure.  If an adventure has more than 2 level ranges each table must choose 2 adjacent level ranges for that adventure.  Only Characters of a level that falls within those two level ranges can play in that adventure at that table.</p>
<p>GMs should adjust the scenario before play begins, following the steps below.</p>
<div class="section" id="calculating-challenge-points">
<h4>Calculating Challenge Points<a class="headerlink" href="#calculating-challenge-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To calculate the number of Challenge Points the party represents, take the following steps.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Record the PCs’ levels. The number of Challenge Points that each PC contributes is based only on their character levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the Adventures “Base Level”.  The base level is the lowest level allowed to play at that table.</p></li>
<li><p>Convert the PCs’ levels to Challenge Points.   Table 1 below notes how many Challenge Points each PC of a given level represents.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, an adventure for levels 1-4  would have a Base Level of 1.  So a 2nd-level PC in such an adventure has a level of Base Level + 1, and by the chart, contributes 3 Challenge Points. A party of five PCs levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 4 would contribute 2, 3, 4, 6, and 6 points respectively.</p>

<h4>Determine the Level Range<a class="headerlink" href="#determine-the-level-range" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Parties with challenge points of 15 or less always play in the lower level range.  Parties with 19 or more always play in the higher level range.</p>
<p>Parties with 16-18 play in the higher level range only if they have 4 or fewer PCs. If they have 5 or more PCs, they play in the lower level range.  This allows small parties of high level adventurers to play in the higher level range, while large parties of low level adventurers play in the lower level range.</p>
<div class="section" id="mentorship-and-pc-level-bumps">
<h5>Mentorship and PC Level Bumps<a class="headerlink" href="#mentorship-and-pc-level-bumps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>To provide low level players a more fun and fair experience, PCs whose level equals the adventure’s base level (such as a 3rd-level PC playing in a Level 3–6 scenario) gain a temporary boost when playing in the higher level range called a level bump to represent the higher-level PCs’ mentorship and support.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Increase every DC the PC has by 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the attack modifiers, attack damage, spell damage, saving throw modifiers, skill modifiers, Perception modifiers, and AC of the PC by 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the Hit Point totals of the PC by 10 or by 10%, whichever is higher.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These adjustments are less beneficial than gaining a level, yet they provide the PC more survivability and opportunity to contribute to the adventure experience, reducing the degree to which higher-level PCs might overshadow these less experienced Pathfinders.</p>
<p>You should also remind higher level PCs to apply any mentor boons they might have purchased.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adjusting-the-adventure">
<h4>Adjusting the Adventure<a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-the-adventure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Once you’ve determined the level range and Challenge Point total, apply the proper modifications to the adventure to provide a fair challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Level Range:</strong> Nearly all encounters list two different sets of creature statistics, one for each of the two level ranges the adventure is designed for. The adventure often also refers to important skill checks and saving throws in room descriptions or during events, listing one DC for the lower level range and one for the higher level range. In each of these cases, use the numbers, creatures, and other information listed for the selected level range.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling:</strong> Within a level range, the scenario will also contain instructions for adjusting the difficulty of the scenario based on the PC’s Challenge Points.  These scaling instructions are generally found in “scaling sidebars” but might also be in the text of the room description or encounter.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Tonya is setting up a Level 1–4 adventure. Her group consists of six players whose PCs are levels 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, and 4. Tonya determines that the base level of the scenario is 1, and then compares each pc’s level to the chart 1. This gives her 2+3+4+4+6+6 for a Challenge Point total of 25.</p>
<p>Step 2 tells Tonya to run the 3–4 level range since her table is 19 CP or more.  It also tells her to apply a level bump and any mentor boons to the level 1 character, increasing that PCs ability to contribute to the adventure.</p>
<p>Step 3 says that for each DC and encounter, Tonya uses the 3–4 level range statistics, modified by any scaling instructions that apply to a CP of 25.  This will probably include adding more opponents and/or more dangerous opponents to fights.</p>

<p><strong>Hero Points:</strong> At the beginning of an adventure, each player receives 1 Hero Point. GMs should then hand out additional Hero Points at a rate of approximately 1 Hero Point per hour of play, following the Guide lines on page <a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=573">507 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Checks:</strong> Unless a scenario says otherwise, GMs are free to choose how to handle secret checks (<a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=334">Core Rulebook 450</a>) on a check-by-check basis and should adapt based on the mood and pacing of the table.</p>
<p>If players rolling their own secret checks use information that their characters would not have to determine their actions—then inform them that their characters would not have that information and try to steer them away from using it.</p>
<div class="section" id="table-variation">
<h3>Table Variation<a class="headerlink" href="#table-variation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A goal of the Pathfinder Society program is to provide a fun, engaging, consistent experience at all tables. GMs should run Pathfinder Society adventures as written, which means:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>No change to major plot points and interactions</p></li>
<li><p>No addition or subtraction to the number of monsters other than scaling directed by the scenario</p></li>
<li><p>No changes to armor, feats, items, skills, spells, statistics, traits, or weapons.</p></li>
<li><p>No alteration of mechanics of player characters,</p></li>
<li><p>Nor banning of  legal character options</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the above, GMs are encouraged to make choices which would result in the most enjoyable play experience for everyone at the table and that emphasize PCs are the heroes of the story. Some examples of GM discretion include the following.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Creatures tactics that have been invalidated by the player actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Unclear rules, or situations or player actions not covered by the rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Terrain or environmental conditions described by the scenario, but not given mechanics.  (If the mechanics are included, however, they cannot be altered.)</p></li>
<li><p>Reactions of NPCs to good roleplaying, and the effect that has on the outcome of the encounter.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternate or creative skills used to bypass or overcome traps, haunts, and skill checks.  (Although the DCs and results of the check are part of the mechanics and should not be changed.)</p></li>
<li><p>Aspects of the scenario’s description and story as appropriate for the players at the table as described in the section A Welcoming Environment on pages <a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=486">485–486 of the Core Rulebook</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes required to comply with the <a class="reference internal" href="standards.html#acceptable-content"><span class="std std-ref">Acceptable Content</span></a> provision of Community Standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Creative solutions presented by players in overcoming obstacles.</p></li>
<li><p>Moving plot points missed by players to encounterable areas (this does not include moving missed treasure bundles).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More details on each of these can be found in the Table Variation Appendix.</p>
<p>If a particular issue comes up repeatedly or causes a significant problem in one of your games, please raise any questions or concerns on the <a class="reference external" href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/organizedPlay/pfsrpg">Pathfinder Society forums</a> where Venture-Officers, members of Paizo’s organized play team, or fellow GMs can help you resolve it.</p>

<div class="section" id="earn-income">
<h4>Earn Income<a class="headerlink" href="#earn-income" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Downtime is spent in Downtime Units of up to 8 days at a time.  If a character earns 8 days or fewer of downtime, it is spent in a single unit.  If they earn more than 8 days, the character spends units of 8 days, one at a time, until 8 or fewer days remain, then spends the remaining days as a single unit.  Multiple different activities can occur in a single downtime unit, but you can only ever roll once for a given activity in any given unit.</p>
<p>If a chronicle is assigned but not immediately applied, (see <a class="reference internal" href="playerBasics.html#applying-credit"><span class="std std-ref">Applying Credit</span></a>) then wait to calculate downtime until the chronicle is applied.  If this happens, the Player can fill out the Downtime themselves.</p>
<p>Earn Income: Earning Income is the most common Downtime activity, though it is the last option to resolve. Complete any Crafting or Retraining before beginning Earn Income checks. GMs should check Table 10–5: DCs by Level (<a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554">Core Rulebook 503</a>) to calculate the Earned Income DC.</p>
<p>Make one check using either the Crafting, Lore, or Performance Skill for each Earn Income Downtime Unit (including units where you complete multiple activities, such as spending 7 days retraining and then 1 day Earning Income). Task Levels for Earn Income checks equal character level – 2 (minimum 0) though some boons allow checks against higher-level tasks. Compare check result to task level on Table 4-2: Income Earned (<a class="reference external" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=23">Core Rulebook 236</a>) for the daily earning rate, then multiply that rate by the number of Downtime days used for Earn Income  in the Downtime Unit. Checks to Earn Income do not carry beyond the Downtime Unit In which the check was made.</p>
<p>The folloeing contains the DC and 8 day earn income values for all possible levels in a given level range.</p>

1. Rare: Apply the very hard modifier from table 10-6 (Core Rulebook 504)</p>
<p>A few other limitations on crafting:</p>
<p>1. Characters can Craft uncommon or rare items only if  they have access to the applicable formulas.
1. Crafting requires that you spend 4 days in preparation before making Crafting checks.
1. Crafting tasks can be continued across as many Downtime days/units as necessary to complete the item.

GMs have a few special rules for assigning and applying characters:</p>

<h4>GM Glyphs<a class="headerlink" href="#gm-glyphs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Pathfinder Society (second edition) offers GMs recognition in the form of glyphs based on the amount of GM credit earned. GM glyphs are visible on your Organized Play ID card and in the paizo.com forums. . GMs obtain the first four levels of glyphs automatically by running and reporting games.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1 Glyph = 10 GM credits</p></li>
<li><p>2 Glyphs = 30 GM credits</p></li>
<li><p>3 Glyphs = 60 GM credits</p></li>
<li><p>4 Glyphs = 100 GM credits</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each Scenario run Grants 1 credit. Quests grant 1/4 credit. Other products grant varying amounts of credits.</p>
<p>To earn 5 glyphs, a GM must fulfill the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Earn 150 GM credits</p></li>
<li><p>Run and report 50 unique adventures</p></li>
<li><p>Run and report 10 adventures with the Exclusive tag</p></li>
<li><p>Complete 3 evaluation games in the presence of a venture-captains, regional venture-coordinators, or Paizo Organized Play staffers using the Organized Play rubric. (See below for the rubric).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To fully experience the benefits of peer review and feedback, we recommend the following observation schedule:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0–10 GM Credits: You’re getting your feet wet. Thanks for GMing!</p></li>
<li><p>11–49 GM Credits: Use the rubric to get a feel for organized play best practices. Consider having a fellow GM sit at your table and give feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>50–99 GM Credits: Ask any venture-officers at your tables to do a rubric evaluation to give feedback as if it were an evaluation game.</p></li>
<li><p>100 GM Credits: Ask a qualifying observer to complete a formal evaluation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All GMs receive the following rewards to use as a player based on the number of GM glyphs that they have earned.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>During initial Hero Point distribution, GMs receive Hero Points equal to their glyphs to distribute to the table. A player cannot gain more than one additional Hero Point from glyphs.</p></li>
<li><p>A number of Chronicle earning Scenario replays equal to one per glyph earned. When using one of these replays, make a note on the chronicle or in your digital record.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Paizo recognizes all 5-glyph GMs by name on blogs on <a class="reference external" href="https://paizo.com/">paizo</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="level-bump-for-adventures">
<h4>Level Bump for Adventures<a class="headerlink" href="#level-bump-for-adventures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Scenarios and quests are designed to challenge PCs whose average level is the lower of the two levels in a given Level Range  (i.e., Level Range 1–2 is built to challenge 1st-level PCs, and Level Range 3–4 is built to challenge 3rd-level PCs). Normally, when the Challenge Point total determines that the group’s overall power is equivalent to the higher level in a Level Range (e.g. 2nd level in Level Range 1–2), the scenario’s scaling will adjust for this.</p>
<p>However, sometimes it is necessary to add a level bump, such as when the scenario’s scaling is based on the number of players, or if the scenario lacks a low tier 16-18 scaling.</p>
<p>Applying a level bump is a simple calculation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Increase every DC listed in the scenario by 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the attack modifiers, attack damage, spell damage, saving throw modifiers, skill modifiers, Perception modifiers, and ACs of all enemy creatures by 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the Hit Point totals of all enemy creatures by 10 or by 10%, whichever is higher.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These straightforward adjustments make the adventure slightly more challenging for higher-level groups, though the adjustments cannot account for the more powerful abilities and spells that higher-level foes would likely have.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">5.6. </span>Table Variations &amp; Creative Solutions<a class="headerlink" href="#table-variations-creative-solutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While the goal of the Pathfinder Society is to provide an even, balanced experience that is fair to all players, every table is different, every character is different, and each GM has their own strengths and weaknesses. We understand that sometimes a Game Master has to make rules adjudications on the fly, deal with unexpected player choices, or even cope with extremely unlucky (or lucky) dice on both sides of the screen.</p>
<p>As a Pathfinder Society GM, you have the right and responsibility to make whatever judgments, within the rules, that you feel are necessary at your table to ensure everyone has a fair and fun experience. This does not mean you can contradict rules or restrictions outlined in this document, a published Pathfinder source, errata document, or official FAQ on paizo.com. What it does mean is that only you can judge what is right for your table during cases not covered in these sources.</p>
<p>A GM can (and should) alter aspects of the scenario’s description and story as appropriate for the players at the table. The A Welcoming Environment section on pages 485–486 of the Core Rulebook provides general guidance about how to make your game inviting and inclusive. A few of these sections benefit from additional clarification and examples in the context of Organized Play.</p>
<p>Unlike in long-term campaigns, players and GMs in Organized Play are likely to have limited time in which to set parameters for objectionable content at the beginning of the game. Furthermore, since Organized Play tables often include people who have never met each other before the game, players might not feel comfortable opening up about what they’d rather avoid right from the beginning.  This means that it’s all the more important to start with a common ground for the campaign, to respect what players do share at the beginning of the session, and be adaptable when it comes to modifying content when problems arise in the course of the session. Pathfinder Society games use the Pathfinder Baseline (Core Rulebook 486) as a starting point when determining what content is appropriate, both for what is present in the published adventures and what is appropriate for player behavior at your table. Add to the Pathfinder Baseline any additional adjustments that are apparent from the situation, such as if you are running a table with children or if you are in a venue with stronger policies about what is appropriate, such as a school.</p>
<p>GMs are empowered to make descriptive adjustments to avoid topics or situations that would cause discomfort for one or more players at the table, such as phobias or other triggering material. For example, a GM could describe a group of spiders as a group of web-shooting lizards or beetles for the comfort of a player with arachnophobia. Mechanically, if a player had an ability that granted benefits against spiders, it would also grant benefits against these other web-shooting creatures during that scenario. Players might not tell you up-front about everything that could cause them trouble; you might learn partway through the session. If this happens, you can “rewind” the description and start over, tweaking the background context of the encounter, or work with the players to create an alternative solution to get around the troublesome aspect of a particular challenge (see Creative Solutions below).</p>
<p>As is the case in general when GMing a table, it is also the GM’s responsibility to ensure that all of the players at the table are respecting each other’s boundaries. If a player refuses to follow along with the adjustment, pushes boundaries, asks insensitive questions, or makes fun of a player voicing discomfort with an aspect of the scenario, the GM should intervene. This intervention might just involve giving the player a warning about their inappropriate behavior, but in egregious or continued cases, the GM can remove the offending player from their table (see Community Standards ).</p>
<p>Whatever changes the GM makes, they should remain true to the fundamental mechanical structure and challenge of the encounter. See the Creative Solutions section below for guidance on how to adjudicate solutions that are not explicitly accounted for in the text of the adventure.</p>
<div class="section" id="creative-solutions">
<h3>Creative Solutions<a class="headerlink" href="#creative-solutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes during the course of a scenario, your players might surprise you with a creative solution to an encounter (or the entire scenario) that you didn’t see coming and that isn’t expressly covered in the scenario. If, for example, your players manage to roleplay their way through a combat and successfully accomplish the goal of that encounter without killing the antagonist, give the PCs the same reward they would have gained had they defeated their opponent in combat. If that scene specifically calls for the PCs to receive gold piece rewards based on the gear collected from the defeated combatants, instead allow the PCs to find a chest of gold (or something similar) that gives them the same rewards. Additionally, if the PCs miss an NPC who carries a specific potion or scroll that the PCs might be granted access to on the scenario’s Chronicle, don’t cross that item off—instead, allow the PCs to find the item elsewhere as a reward for creatively resolving the encounter without resorting to combat.</p>
<p>The Pathfinder Society never wants to give the impression that the only way to solve a problem is to kill it. Rewarding the creative use of skills and roleplaying not only make Society games more fun for the players, but it also gives the GM a level of flexibility in ensuring players receive the rewards they are due.</p>
<p>But what if your players accidentally or intentionally kill an important NPC who was supposed to give them a crucial piece of information that’s needed for the scenario to progress? This is a tough problem for the GM and requires improvisation. Don’t decide the scenario is over just because the old man with the letter was caught in a magical crossfire and roasted alive, destroying both him and the important letter. Reveal that the letter survived by some twist of fate (it was in a fire-proof pouch in his pocket) or perhaps that the old man had a lackey who was watching from a nearby alley and knows everything the old man did, or another similar explanation. Improvisation will keep your scenario moving forward and help you work around unforeseen obstacles. For more guidance on handling the PCs’ treasure and rewards when they use creative solutions, see the Treasure Bundles section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="secret-checks">
<h2><span class="section-number">5.7. </span>Secret Checks<a class="headerlink" href="#secret-checks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Pathfinder Second Edition, some checks, such as checks to Recall Knowledge, have the secret trait. Secret checks fall into two broad categories. The first category includes checks that characters do not know exist, such as a check against a hidden threat that the PCs did not notice. The second category includes checks for which players would gain significant extra information that their characters would not have if they knew how well they rolled. Recall Knowledge checks are the broadest type of checks that fall into this category. Characters that critically fail a Recall Knowledge check gain false information, so if players know that they rolled very low, they might have trouble avoiding metagaming. Similarly, if the players all rolled low on a check to Seek, they might find themselves tempted to metagame and have everyone roll again because they know that there is likely something that they didn’t find.</p>
<p>The secret trait is a tool to help separate character knowledge and player knowledge, but, as listed in the secret check rules on page 450 of the Core Rulebook, GMs can at any time allow their players to roll their own results on secret checks. Some scenarios will make recommendations, such as directing GMs to keep a particularly pivotal check’s results hidden or to let players roll a string of checks in the open to keep gameplay moving. Unless a scenario says otherwise, GMs are free to choose how to handle secret checks on a check-by-check basis. GMs can keep all secret checks secret, have players roll all secret checks, or adapt on the fly based on the mood and pacing of the table. If players rolling their own secret checks do metagame—that is, use information that their characters would not have to determine their actions—then inform them that their characters would not have that information and try to steer them away from using it. In general, it can be useful to have players roll their own checks if there are many secret rolls in one section, and useful to roll for the players if you suspect that there will be a strong temptation to metagame or that the extra information of the result could negatively impact the experience for players at the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="treasure-bundles">
<h2><span class="section-number">5.8. </span>Treasure Bundles<a class="headerlink" href="#treasure-bundles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the course of completing a scenario, characters are likely to encounter, if not acquire, all 10 Treasure Bundles as part of overcoming challenges and inspecting their surroundings. That said, a non-linear adventure might include encounter areas (and treasure) the PCs miss entirely, and there might be small portions of treasure that a group would overlook entirely (such as hidden in a concealed room). As a result, even a capable party might not secure all 10 Treasure Bundles. Taking into account the free consumable items granted to PCs at the beginning of adventures, the wealth earned by Pathfinder Society characters is slightly higher than the standard provided in the Core Rulebook. That means that although missing a Treasure Bundle stings, it’s accounted for in the campaign.</p>
<p>However, awarding fewer than the maximum Treasure Bundles shouldn’t be a punitive tool. Unless recovering a Treasure Bundle is tied to succeeding at key skill checks or making key choices, PCs who overcome an encounter with creative solutions should earn the same reward they would have earned by defeating that foe in combat. Adventures call out special exceptions, such as treasure only accessible if the PCs investigate a particular secret door or agree to an NPC’s proposal. If the PCs’ actions allow them to bypass the area or encounter where they would have the chance to recover the treasure, it’s okay to relocate the opportunity to a later point with similar requirements to recover the treasure.</p>
<p>Example: The PCs are supposed to attack a keep, and they successfully trick the guards into escorting the PCs to the final encounter with the evil warlord rather than fighting their way in. By tricking the guards, the PC not only skip the guards fight (which has 2 Treasure Bundles associated with it) and never have a chance to pick up the easily-discovered magic wand in the guardroom (1 additional Treasure Bundle), but they also skip a fight with a minotaur (who guards coins representing 2 Treasure Bundles). The PCs should receive credit for these rewards anyway; they overcame the guards encounter, bypassed the minotaur, and would have easily recovered the treasure afterward.</p>
<p>However, escorting the PCs through the keep also means the PCs neither explore the side rooms nor have a chance to find the secret vault where a golden chalice is hidden (1 Treasure Bundle). Finding this vault would have required a PC Searching during exploration and succeeding at a DC 20 Perception check, and the room’s rewards cite that the PCs should only receive this reward if they find the room and recover the chalice. In this case the PCs should have a fair opportunity to find the chalice anyway, such as the secret door and room being relocated to the warlord’s throne room with the same Perception check DC.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="edicts-and-anathema-in-society-play">
<h2><span class="section-number">5.9. </span>Edicts and Anathema in Society Play<a class="headerlink" href="#edicts-and-anathema-in-society-play" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To allow a wide variety of characters in Society play, the rules around edicts and anathema are slightly relaxed. All characters can participate in Pathfinder Society adventures without running afoul of their deity or classes anathema.  Assume that the society has taken whatever steps are necessary such that attempting to perform the primary objective of an official Pathfinder Society mission by itself will not cause a character to fall out of favor with their deity.</p>
<p>Likewise, while edicts are valorous actions praised by a deity, a character does not need to perform their deity’s edicts to the exclusion of other activities, or if doing so would prevent the smooth progression of play at the table.</p>
<p>Anathema in pathfinder society are always personal.  The actions of one PC at a table can never cause another PC at the table to fall. (Though players are welcome to express their disapproval provided it does not interfere with the progress of the game.)</p>
<p>Remember that edicts and anathema exist to create roleplaying opportunities at the table for your character, and should not be used by the GM to pressure PCs, or by PCs to pressure other members of the table toward specific styles of play.</p>

<div class="section" id="dealing-with-chronicle-errors">
<h3>Dealing with Chronicle Errors<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-chronicle-errors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When reviewing a Chronicle, if you notice anything that seems amiss, you can ask the player to explain any discrepancies to you. Remember that errors are far more likely to be honest mistakes than intentional cheating, and that it’s possible that they aren’t errors at all.  Most errors turn out to be detrimental to characters, not to their advantage!</p>
<p>When you ask the player about a discrepancy, speak with the player calmly, nicely, and with an open mind. Resolve any issues as fairly as possible. For example, if the character selected an option that they did not have access to or that was not available to their character, let them pick another option instead. If they did not pay the full price for an item they have, they can pay for it in full, or, if they haven’t used it yet, simply remove the item from their character’s gear. If they paid too much for an item, refund them the extra they paid in the “items sold” section of their Chronicle. Check with your event coordinator, Venture-Captain, or Venture-Lieutenant if you are unsure of how to fix a mistake, or if you and the player cannot come to an agreement about a fair resolution. Remember that the game is supposed to be fun, so waste as little time as possible on drama and spend as much time as possible providing an exciting, action-packed scenario for your players.</p>

<div class="section" id="dealing-with-death">
<h3>Dealing with Death<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-death" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given the dangers characters face once they become Pathfinders, character death is a very real possibility (and a necessary one to maintain a sense of risk and danger in the game). Consider, however, that for a player new to Pathfinder Society, or to the Pathfinder RPG in general, having their character experience a violent death during their first game can sour him on the campaign and the game altogether. While we don’t advocate fudging die rolls, consider the experience of the players when deciding whether to use especially lethal tactics or if a character is in extreme danger of death, especially when the player is new to the game. Most players whose first experience in a campaign results in a character death don’t return to the campaign.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the entire party is killed and can’t be brought back to life, then the table is over for everyone in the party. This means those players might have a substantial span of time before their next event at a convention with no game to play. Obviously, we hope that such total party kills never happen (and strive to balance the scenarios to make it unlikely)—but, sometimes, the dice just aren’t with you and everyone passes into the Great Beyond.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dealing-with-out-of-game-problems">
<h3>Dealing with out of game problems<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-out-of-game-problems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes circumstances prevent a player from completing a scenario. Reasons include—but are not limited to—personal emergencies, device battery issues, venue problems, and bad timing. To mitigate the impact on the table, GMs can exercise their discretion by adjusting the scenario’s level range or Challenge Point Adjustment to accommodate the table’s new Challenge Point Total, bring in the pregenerated character that most closely resembles the lost PC, or postpone the game until all players are able to complete the scenario. In the event that a character sheet is no longer accessible due to a loss of battery power, the player can play the pregenerated character and apply the scenario’s rewards to their original character. In all cases where the GM applies one of the above remedies, rewards for all players are based on the lowest level range played during the scenario.</p>
<p>If a player is forced to leave the table, and the game continues, the GM should endeavor to get a chronicle to the player as soon as possible.  When filling out this chronicle the Player should receive 1 XP per hour played for scenarios.  They recieve any reputation rewarded for the tasks the party has completed up to that point, as well as any treasure bundles found, and any items found that were listed on the chronicles.</p>
<p>In the (hopefully rare) case of a medical emergency (defined as a player needing immediate, unexpected, professional medical treatment) the chronicle should be filled out as if the player stayed for the rest of the game, receiving the same benefits as the rest of the table.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Distractions<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-distractions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>No game table is completely free of distractions. However, if something (like an electronic device) creates an ongoing distraction, a GM can request that the player put it away or police their use of the device (such as not also using a tablet computer to play a video game). If the device continues to be a distraction, the GM has the right to ban that particular item for the duration of the game.</p>

<h3>Cheating<a class="headerlink" href="#cheating" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cheating is rare, and it can be a rather heated topic. If you suspect that a player is cheating, it’s always a good idea to take a step back and consider the possibility that they are instead making an honest mistake. Inaccurate numbers on a character or mistakes on a Chronicle are far more likely to be math errors than deliberate cheating. When you see these issues, keep an open mind and work with the player to resolve them. Other issues, such as lying about the results of a dice roll or the contents of their character sheet or breaking the rules even after being informed of what they are, are more clear-cut. If you believe the player to be cheating, record the organized play number of the player in question and then ask them to leave your table. Afterward, send an e-mail to the Pathfinder Society staff at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:organizedplay&#37;&#52;&#48;paizo&#46;com">organizedplay<span>&#64;</span>paizo<span>&#46;</span>com</a>, including the player’s number and detailing as much as you can remember about the situation.</p>
