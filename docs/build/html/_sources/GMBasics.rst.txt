Game Master Basics
==================

Running Pathfinder Society games is similar to running a home campaign with a few house rules established by campaign leadership. In addition to GM Basics, be sure to familiarize yourself with the contents of the Welcome to Pathfinder Society, Community Standards and Expectations, and Player Basics. You need to know what players know, what their expectations are, and how their characters are created, played, and advanced.

What Is A GM?
=============
A Game Master (GM) is the person who presents the story, adjudicates the rules, and establishes the parameters of the player’s exploration. A GM’s duty is to provide a fair and fun game for all involved, including themselves. In the Pathfinder Society, a GM has a few other duties, listed in Your Duties as a Game Master below.

Who Can Be A Game Master?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Anyone with a valid Organized Play ID can run Pathfinder Society adventures. As local Pathfinder Society groups and the campaign as a whole benefit as the pool of Game Masters increases, the venture-officer network provides support and guidance for any who want to GM. 

Your Duties As Game Master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a Pathfinder Society GM, you have the following duties:
- Communicate with your local event coordinator. 
- Prepare an adventure to offer to players, including gathering the necessary supplies such as maps, miniatures, and reference materials.
- Provide a welcoming environment for players.
- Deliver session results to the player via established recording mechanisms.
- Report the results of the game.

Where Can I Buy Adventures?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Paizo produces two categories of adventures, available for purchase at `paizo.com <https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety>`_. 

Pathfinder Society adventures, including quests, scenarios, and bounties, generally release during the last week of each month. Current production rates include two new scenarios and one bounty monthly, with additional Society content released periodically throughout the year. These adventures are written expressly for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign.

Pathfinder Adventures, including Adventure Paths, Modules, and Stand-alone adventures, are produced monthly. These adventures are oftentimes sanctioned for use in the Pathfinder Society campaign. Information on how to incorporate them into your Society experience is found on each product’s description page at paizo.com. (See Types of Adventures for more about these products.)

Before the Adventure
====================
Reviewing Chronicles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If time permits, GMs and Event Coordinators should spend a few minutes reviewing players’ Chronicles at the start of an event slot. These reviews can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, GMs might need to check to the Adventure Summary section to learn what a character did in a previous adventure, and GMs and Coordinators can review Chronicles to ensure that they are filled out correctly. These reviews can help ensure that players understand the rules of Pathfinder and the Pathfinder Society Campaign, as well as catch the errors that naturally crop up in the course of play.  (See “Dealing with Chronicle Errors” for more on this.)

Challenge Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In a typical home game, the PCs would all be the same level and face challenges tailored to their level. In an organized play environment, though, there needs to be more flexibility to make it easier for players whose characters are of different levels to participate in the same adventure.

Each scenario or quest will list the levels of characters able to play in it, as well one or more level ranges within the adventure.  If an adventure has more than 2 level ranges each table must choose 2 adjacent level ranges for that adventure.  Only Characters of a level that falls within those two level ranges can play in that adventure at that table.

GMs should adjust the scenario before play begins, following the steps below.

1. Calculating Challenge Points
*******************************
To calculate the number of Challenge Points the party represents, take the following steps.

- Record the PCs’ levels. The number of Challenge Points that each PC contributes is based only on their character levels.  
- Determine the Adventures “Base Level”.  The base level is the lowest level allowed to play at that table.
- Convert the PCs’ levels to Challenge Points.   Table 1 below notes how many Challenge Points each PC of a given level represents.

**Challenge Points**

+-----------------+------------------------+
| Character Level | PointsChallenge Points |
+-----------------+------------------------+
| Base Level      | 2                      |
+-----------------+------------------------+
| Basel Level +1  | 3                      |
+-----------------+------------------------+
| Base Level +2   | 4                      |
+-----------------+------------------------+
| Base Level +3   | 6                      |
+-----------------+------------------------+

For example, an adventure for levels 1-4  would have a Base Level of 1.  So a 2nd-level PC in such an adventure has a level of Base Level + 1, and by the chart, contributes 3 Challenge Points. A party of five PCs levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 4 would contribute 2, 3, 4, 6, and 6 points respectively.

- Total the PCs’ Challenge Points. 
- If playing a table with fewer than 4 PCs, use the following chart to determine what level of Pregens to add, and how many additional challenge points.

| | *This table is only legal if all players at the table agree.               |
| | While we expect this “hard mode” playthrough experience to be satisfying,  |
| | we want to caution you that, as the adventures are designed for a minimum  |
| | of four players, they will be more difficult than normal.                  |
