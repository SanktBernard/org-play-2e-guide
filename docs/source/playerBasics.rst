Character Creation
==================
This page details the steps for creating a character for the Pathfinder Society. These steps mirror those in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook with a few additional Roleplaying Guild-specific rules and benefits.

Character Sheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no standard character sheet format required.  The only requirements are that it must be legible, clear, and reviewable by the GM. Blank analog character sheets for Pathfinder 2nd edition can be found:

Resources
~~~~~~~~~
Players may use any Paizo published books or supplements they own during character creation, provided the options are valid per the `Character Options resource document <https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shcs?Rarity-and-Availability-in-Organized-Play>`_, Players residing in the same household may share owned resources. Options in the `Core Rulebook <https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp3?Pathfinder-Core-Rulebook>`_ and `Lost Omens: Character Guide <https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide>`_ are considered always available resources regardless of ownership.

Character Creation Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following steps elaborate and expand on character creation for Pathfinder Society characters. (`Core Rulebook 21 <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=66>`_)

1. Create a Concept
*******************
Remember, your character is a member of the Pathfinder Society first and foremost, and as such, your character should be able to work with any other Pathfinder, and abide by the Society’s Motto – **“Explore, Report, Cooperate”**.

2. Start Building Ability Scores
********************************
Pathfinder Society uses the standard method detailed under “Ability Score Overview” on `page 20 of the Core Rulebook <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=74>`_. Your character can also take two additional ability flaws to gain one additional ability boost as described in the `Voluntary Flaws sidebar on page 26 of the Core Rulebook <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=86>`_.

3. Select an Ancestry
*********************
Ancestry follows the normal rules in the *Core Rulebook*, with minor modifications to adapt to the languages of Golarion.  The Pathfinder society does not permit Half-elves or Half-orcs of ancestries other than Human.

**Home Region** 
This is also the stage at which you should choose your character’s home region (Core Rulebook 420-429), and in the case of human characters, your ethnicity. (Core Rulebook 430-431).  Home regions fulfill access requirements and prerequisites for character options. See Rarity for more information.

**Languages**
All Pathfinder Society characters are literate and speak Common (Taldan) as well as any other languages granted by their ancestry. Regional languages (Core Rulebook 432) are uncommon and require access.

4. Pick A Background
********************
Players who participated in the Pathfinder Society (first edition) campaign have access to Legacy Backgrounds in addition to the backgrounds starting on page 60 of the Core Rulebook. 

5. Choose a Class
*****************
All Pathfinder Society characters begin at 1st level, although some boons allow a character to immediately advance to 2nd or 3rd level at the end of character creation

6. Determine Ability Scores
***************************
The Pathfinder Society follows the standard rules for Determining Ability scores.

7. Record Class Details
***********************
The Pathfinder society follows all the standard rules for Class Details.

8. Buy Equipment
****************
All characters in Pathfinder Society begin with the standard 15 gold pieces (150 silver pieces) that can be spent on starting gear. Chapter 6 of the Core Rulebook has a wide array of useful starting gear. Page 289 of the Core Rulebook includes class kits, prebuilt selections of gear tailored to each of the core classes. You can also spend your wealth to purchase additional gear, as described in the Purchasing Guidelines.

9. Calculate Modifiers
**********************
Calculate your character’s Perception, Saving Throws, Strikes, and Skill modifiers as described on page 27 of the `Core Rulebook <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=89>`_. 

10. Finishing Details
*********************
**Alignment**
Players cannot play evil characters. When choosing an alignment, be sure it satisfies any alignment requirements for your character’s class.

**Religion**
Characters can worship any Golarion deity so long as their alignment matches one of the deity’s listed follower alignments. Champions and clerics must choose a valid deity, though other classes can worship one of the faiths and philosophies presented on page 440 of Core Rulebook or another legal source. Characters can also be agnostic or atheist.

Characters can revere deities they do not worship. Revering a deity means that your character might do things like wearing the deity’s holy symbol, attending the deity’s religious services, or performing other acts of obeisance that aren’t rewarded with spells or divine powers. 

A character can revere as many deities as they wish, but can worship and receive power from only one.

**Age**
Characters must be at least young adults to be accepted as members of the Pathfinder Society.

**Other Items**
The beginning of Pathfinder Society games includes character introductions, so consider making a few notes on your character’s appearance, personality, and pronouns to share with other players. The World of Pathfinder Society and the `Lost Omens: Character Guide <https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide>`_ both contain information on the campaign setting you can use for this purpose.

Pathfinder uses maps with a standard 1-inch grid to determine movement and tactical positioning in combat, so you need a physical representation of your character to use on the grid. Paizo produces a wide range of Pathfinder Pawns and also works with Reaper Miniatures and WizKids to offer a wide variety of gaming miniatures, so you can find just the right figure for your character.

For digital play, this should be a digital image.  Speak to your DM about their preferred image formats and size requirements.

11. Membership in the Pathfinder Society
****************************************
During their training, Pathfinder initiates attain a certain level of proficiency in all three schools’ teachings, from there some go on to specialize in one of the schools’ curricula and build life-long professional contacts with like-minded scholars while others continue to divide their time among the different schools. These contacts pay out over the course of a Pathfinder’s career in the form of  gifts from colleagues.  In practice, these relationships provides characters one or more consumable items at the beginning of each scenario. In return, the field agent’s expected to return the favor by contributing labor, teaching expertise, lab assistance, or more between missions, reinforcing these professional relationships.  

Another way to join the Pathfinder Society is via a field commission from another agent or a Venture-Captain of the Society. Characters who received a field commission have fewer connections to the Society’s  membership, and receive fewer gifts, but have fewer obligations to the society and thus more downtime.  

**Pathfinder Training**
Each character should choose one of the following: Spells, Scrolls Swords, Generalist, or Field Commission. Each of these choices grants a bonus lore at first level, and a bonus skill feat at 5th level. Each Pathfinder Training (except Field Commission) also grants a bonus consumable at the beginning of each mission.

Rewards
=======

Boons
~~~~~
Boons are rewards that can be applied to a character. Common types of boons include Achievemnet Points (AcP), Chronicle, or Faction.  Boons often have traits that describe how the boon applies. There are some boon traits that deserve specific mention:

- **Advanced**:  A boon with the Advanced trait is typically more powerful than other boons.  Characters may only benefit from one advanced boon during an adventure.
- **Ally**: A boon with the Ally trait often places a Pawn. An Ally boon that places a Pawn cannot be used if the PC has already placed a second Pawn this game..
- **Promotional**: These boons reward players for promoting the society, or for exceptional contributions to the campaign. Characters may only benefit from one advanced boon during an adventure.
Unless a boon states otherwise, you can only apply one of any given boon to a character.

Promotional Boons

These boons are available, automatically, to any player who meets their requirements.

A list of  Achievement Points rewards available for purchase lives on the Boon tab of your `My Organized Play page <https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs>`_. To purchase a boon, select a character from the dropdown list, then click the purchase button of the desired boon. A list of purchased boons appears at the bottom of the page. Each purchased boon generates a downloadable printable boon. AcP boons should be stored with Chronicles, either digitally or alongside physical sheets. 

Retail Incentive Program 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Retail Incentive Program (RIP) rewards players with rewards for their characters when they patronize retailers who are providing space for Organized Play activities.  Purchases made at the location within a stated time frame tally by table and unlock benefits at different levels, including some that reduce the severity of failures, for the next game played. Implementation methods vary from store to store, and are posted for attendees to review. For more information, read the `full policy <https://paizo.com/organizedplay/policies#retailers>`_ and consult your Event Organizer for details.

Legacy Backgrounds (legacy campaign) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Even though characters from the First Edition legacy campaign cannot transfer into the current Pathfinder Society campaign, their exploits can shape the Society’s newest adventurers. For each of the 11 seasons of the legacy campaign, a player can unlock a special legacy character background associated with that season by having completed five or more of that season’s scenarios. These backgrounds are unique to the Pathfinder Society campaign, and once they’re unlocked, a player use a legacy background for any number of characters. See Legacy Backgrounds.

Faction Reputation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By representing a faction during adventures or participating in adventures vital to a faction’s interests, a character gains Reputation with the represented faction. The greater a character’s Reputation the more respected and influential they are with that faction. Characters can represent more that one Faction in their career, but only one per adventure. Some scenarios grant bonus Reputation with particular factions; this doesn’t prevent characters from choosing to represent a different Faction.

Pathfinder Society uses the Reputation subsystem (`Gamemastery Guide 164 <https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1234>`_)  with the following modifications:  

Reputations
***********
+------------+--------+
| Reputation | Points |
+============+========+
| Ignored    | 0-19   |
+------------+--------+
| Liked      | 20-59  |
+------------+--------+
| Admired    | 60-119 |
+------------+--------+
| Revered    | 120+   |
+------------+--------+

Reputation in PFS does not use negative values. Major infractions earn Infamy.

Character rewards unlocked by Reputation are found on the Boon Tab of your `My Organized Play page <https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs>`_. Rewards can unlock based on Reputation with a single faction, or the total amount of Reputation your character has earned across all factions.

Other Rewards 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pathfinder Society Organized Play periodically releases additional prizes for special events. The most common among these are charity boons, which are in-game benefits sent to authorized charity events to help raise money for good causes. For more information on Charity Boons, ask the Event Organizer.
